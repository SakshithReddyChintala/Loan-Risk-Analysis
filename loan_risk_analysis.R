#-------------------------------Gramener Case Study-------------------------------------------

##Setting path & importing neccessary libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)

##Fetching & Analysing dataset
loan=read.csv("loan.csv")
View(loan)     #View dataset
str(loan)      #To check datatype of all variables
summary(loan)  #To check NA values & statistical measures

##-----------------------------Data Cleaning-----------------------------------------------
#1.Deleting/Filter unnecessary columns with all NA values
allNA<-c(which(sapply(loan, function(x)all(is.na(x)))))
allNA<-c(sapply(loan, function(x)all(is.na(x))))
allNA<-as.data.frame(allNA)
toRemove<-allNA[,1]
loan[c(toRemove)] <- list(NULL) 

#2.Imputing NA values
#chargeoff_within_12_mths,pub_rec_bankruptcies,tax_liens,title,collections_12_mths_ex_med can be imputed
#is.na(loan$chargeoff_within_12_mths)<-0 #Ignored as imputation not relevent for below EDA

#3.Removing irrelevant columns
loan$pymnt_plan<-NULL  #Removed as all rows have same value 'n'
loan$url<-NULL #Not relevent for EDA
loan$initial_list_status<-NULL #Removed as all rows have same value 'f'
loan$application_type<-NULL #Removed as all rows have same value 'INDIVIDUAL'
loan$desc<-NULL #As text description not relevent for EDA without processing text 
loan$policy_code<-NULL #Removed as all rows have same value '1'

#4.Adding relevant column names
colnames(loan)[1] <- "loan_id"

#5.Standardising Values
#a)Rounding total_pymnt,total_rec_late_fee,funded_amnt_inv to 2 decimal places
round(loan$total_pymnt, digits = 2)
round(loan$total_rec_late_fee, digits = 2)
round(loan$funded_amnt_inv, digits = 2)
round(loan$collection_recovery_fee, digits = 2)

#b)Converting emp_length to numeric as per data dictionary
pattern="\\d{1,2}"
convert_emp_length <- function(x){
  if(!is.na(str_extract(x,"< 1"))){
    return(0)
  }
  exp=as.numeric(str_extract(x,pattern))
  return(exp)
}
loan$emp_length<-c(sapply(loan$emp_length, convert_emp_length))

#c)Removing Outliers
#Outliers are not removed as this data is relevent, only removed in few plots for clarity 

#d)Converting issue_d, earliest_cr_line, last_pymnt_d, last_credit_pull_d to Date
library(lubridate) 
loan$earliest_cr_line<-parse_date_time(paste("01-",loan$earliest_cr_line),orders = c("d-b-y"))
loan$last_pymnt_d<-parse_date_time(paste("01-",loan$last_pymnt_d),orders = c("d-b-y"))
loan$issue_d<-parse_date_time(paste("01-",loan$issue_d),orders = c("d-b-y"))
loan$last_credit_pull_d<-parse_date_time(paste("01-",loan$last_credit_pull_d),orders = c("d-b-y"))

#e)Converting percentages to fractions for correlation analysis 
loan$int_rate=as.numeric(sub("%", "", loan$int_rate))
loan$revol_util=as.numeric(sub("%", "", loan$revol_util))

#f)Converting grades to numeric
levels(loan$sub_grade)
values<-seq(1,7,by=0.2)
#values[loan$sub_grade]
loan$rank<-values[loan$sub_grade]
